# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** Aby (often uses `aby` / `admin`)
- **What to call them:** Aby
- **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
- **Timezone:** *(unknown)*
- **Notes:** Prefers fast iteration but strict UI protection rules (especially Landing Page). Values premium Mission Control aesthetic (dark glass, crisp white text, orange accents) and wants changes verified before committing/pushing.

## Context

### What they care about
- **Mission Control UI**: glassmorphism, deep blacks, subtle orange energy, premium micro-interactions.
- **Stability**: “Don’t change other pages/backgrounds” when working on one feature.
- **Landing page protection**: landing page is locked to Feb 2, 2026 reference state; never change without explicit approval.

### Recurring pain points
- **GitHub push issues**: intermittent DNS failures (`Could not resolve host: github.com`) and/or auth/credentials issues (`Device not configured`).
- **Deploy friction**: Vercel/Railway builds are strict; TypeScript unused vars/params can break deploys.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
