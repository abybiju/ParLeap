# Daily Memory - February 5, 2026

## Bible Mode + Projector Fonts
- Added Bible mode toggle and version selector in Operator HUD; settings persist to `events.bible_mode` + `events.bible_version_id` and broadcast over WebSocket.
- Added Bible tables migration `008_add_bible_tables.sql` and ingestion script to flatten KJV JSON dataset and insert into Supabase.
- Fixed BOM parsing in ingest script so KJV JSON loads cleanly.
- Added RLS policy migration `009_bible_versions_select.sql` for authenticated reads of `bible_versions`.
- Backend now falls back to default Bible version if none is selected; UI auto-selects default.
- Verse reference parsing MVP: “Luke 2:13” renders verse on Operator + Projector.
- Added ESV API support (on-demand fetch via API; no ESV text stored).
- Voice commands switch versions (“Reading from the ESV”, “Back to KJV”) with session-sticky state.

## STT + Session Stability
- Adjusted STT watchdog thresholds to avoid false errors during silence.
- Session no longer flips to Error on non-fatal STT issues; STT status shows “Listening (Awaiting speech).”
- Fixed resume flow: after Bible mode off, songs re-acquire and slides advance again (temporary backward match window).
