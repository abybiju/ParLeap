## Profile Settings + Avatar System (Presets + Device Upload)

### What shipped
- **Profile Settings page**: Sidebar tabs (General / Account / Security / Billing) at `frontend/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`, with Back-to-Dashboard nav.
- **Avatar selection**:
  - Preset emoji avatars (e.g. `rocket`, `planet`)
  - Preset image avatars stored under `frontend/public/avatars/presets/*` and saved as `preset:*` IDs
  - Device upload via Supabase Storage (bucket: `avatars`) saved as a public URL
- **UI polish**:
  - Fixed invisible outline-button text issues (notably “Cancel” and “Reset Password”)
  - Added subtle orange hover glow to Profile cards to match the brand vibe
  - `DashboardHeader` now renders the current avatar (preset image / emoji / uploaded URL) instead of always showing initials

### Supabase operational notes
- If the app errors with: `Could not find the 'avatar' column of 'profiles' in the schema cache`:
  - Ensure `public.profiles.avatar` exists (run migration SQL if needed)
  - Reload PostgREST schema cache (fallback SQL: `select pg_notify('pgrst', 'reload schema');`)
- Device uploads require:
  - Public Storage bucket `avatars`
  - RLS policies from `supabase/migrations/005_setup_avatar_storage.sql`

### CI/CD gotchas encountered
- Vercel + `tsc --noEmit` will fail on **unused vars/params**; fixed by removing unused destructuring and prefixing unused params with `_`.
- `next/image` does not reliably support `blob:` previews and external URLs without config; used `<img>` for those cases.

### GitHub push blocker
- Push failures occurred due to machine/network/credential issues:
  - DNS: `Could not resolve host: github.com`
  - Credentials: `could not read Username for 'https://github.com': Device not configured`
- Workaround: push from local machine with proper auth (PAT/SSH or `gh auth login`).
