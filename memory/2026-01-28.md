## Header Navigation Layout Improvements

### What We Accomplished
- **Header Component Enhancements:**
  - Increased header height from `h-16` (64px) to `h-20` (80px) for better visual hierarchy
  - Added top padding `pt-6` (24px) to push header down from viewport top
  - Repositioned navigation links (Features, Pricing, Download) to sit between logo and buttons using `flex-1 justify-end` instead of centered layout
  - Reduced nav link gap from `gap-8` to `gap-6` for tighter spacing
  - Maintained responsive behavior (nav links hidden on mobile with `hidden md:flex`)

- **Hero Section Adjustments:**
  - Updated top padding from `pt-40` (160px) to `pt-48` (192px) to account for taller header
  - Ensured proper spacing so content doesn't overlap with header

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified:**
  - `frontend/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Layout restructure with flex positioning
  - `frontend/components/landing/HeroSection.tsx` - Padding adjustment

- **Layout Approach:**
  - Three-section flex layout: Logo (left, flex-shrink-0) → Nav Links (middle, flex-1 justify-end) → Buttons (right, flex-shrink-0)
  - This creates natural spacing without forcing center alignment
  - Visual spacing: 24px top padding + 80px header height = 104px total header space
