## Session: Landing page — "Ready for any song" + album art (WorshipStream)

### What we did

**1. Ready for any song (FlowScrollLine)**
- Replaced LyricWall with FlowScrollLine on landing: scroll-driven SVG curve + song titles (CCLI Top 100 style).
- **Songs**: 12 titles in 4-column grid. Added "What A Beautiful Name", "King Of Kings". Shortened "Firm Foundation (He Won't)" → "Firm Foundation".
- **Spacing**: Reduced big gap between heading and song titles — subheading `mb-12` → `mb-4`, line-to-grid `mt-10` → `mt-5`, section `py-24` → `py-12 lg:py-16`, removed `min-h-[380px]` so section aligns tightly.

**2. Album art (WorshipStream) — keep updating + top charts**
- **Dual source**: iTunes Search (`modern+worship` albums) + Apple Music top albums RSS (`rss.applemarketingtools.com/.../most-played/50/albums.json`). Merged: worship first, then top charts, deduped by id, max 40.
- **Refresh**: Every 6 hours (interval) and on window focus. If a fetch fails, we keep showing current list (only update when we have new results).
- **Resilience**: Use `Promise.allSettled` so if one source fails (e.g. CORS on RSS from localhost), the other still shows — e.g. worship albums always show even when top-charts feed is blocked.
