## Operator HUD Premium Pass (WIP)
- Updated Operator HUD layout to a broadcast control room style with a command bar, signal stack, live display panel, and integrated command dock.
- Refined typography and slide presentation for a more premium display surface.
- Compact next slide preview styling to match the new docked layout.

Files touched:
- frontend/components/operator/OperatorHUD.tsx
- frontend/components/operator/CurrentSlideDisplay.tsx
- frontend/components/operator/NextSlidePreview.tsx
## End-of-line Advance Reliability (WIP)
- Added adaptive end-words extraction (short lines use fixed counts, longer lines use percentage).
- Lowered end-trigger threshold and added hybrid trigger using next-line confidence.
- Added end-trigger debounce in WebSocket handler (2 consecutive hits within 1.8s) to reduce false triggers.

Files touched:
- backend/src/services/matcherService.ts
- backend/src/websocket/handler.ts
