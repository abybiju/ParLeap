# Daily Log — February 13, 2026

## Session: Bible Semantic Refinements + Docs/Memory Update

### What Shipped (Bible)
- Semantic (vector) for Bible only: verse-by-content open, Bible Follow, in-chapter jump. Full-Bible keyword + semantic; chapter-only refs ("Luke 1" → 1:1); book soundalikes ("roman" → Romans) and fuzzy book match.
- In-chapter jump works well; cross-chapter/cross-book jump path exists but not yet reliable (on backlog).

### Backlog Saved
1. Improve cross-chapter/cross-book jump by content.
2. Reduce Bible verse latency (measure and optimize carefully).
3. Brainstorm open-source semantic (e.g. Hugging Face model in Node.js/Edge Function).

### Docs Updated
- `BIBLE_SEMANTIC_BACKLOG.md` created (shipped + backlog).
- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` — Bible semantic recent updates + backlog pointer.
- `MEMORY.md` — Session Feb 13 Bible semantic + backlog.
- `.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc` — Bible semantic features + Important Files.
- `memory/2026-02-13.md` — this log.

### Commits (Bible + docs)
- `7557b45` — feat(bible): chapter-only refs, book soundalikes, fuzzy book, cross-chapter jump
- (This commit: docs and memory update.)

## Session: Community Template Crash Fixes + Ongoing Auto-Apply Debug

### What Was Fixed
- Prevented Song Editor crash from malformed template payloads:
  - Guarded template usability in frontend (`id`, `slides`, `line_count`, valid ranges).
  - Added safe fallback rendering when template identifiers are missing.
- Added form-field cleanup for autofill warning:
  - Added explicit `name` for file input.
  - Removed duplicate `name` override on lyrics textarea.
- Added backend normalization for `template_stats` responses:
  - Maps `template_id` to `id`.
  - Normalizes legacy `slides` shapes (`{ slides: [...] }` and `line_count`-style slide arrays).
  - Filters invalid rows server-side before returning to frontend.

### Commits Pushed
- `e2aaf79` — fix: harden template rendering against malformed ids
- `1de8451` — fix: normalize template_stats rows and legacy slide payloads
- `d40520e` — chore: add name to file input, drop duplicate name on lyrics

### Current Status
- Crash is resolved (page no longer breaks on CCLI + lyrics input).
- Auto-format still not reliably applying in Song Editor preview for some cases (shows `None applied` and keeps pasted lines).

### Exact Follow-up for Tomorrow
1. Inspect runtime result of `GET /api/templates?ccli=<CCLI>&lineCount=<editor_line_count>`.
2. Verify returned template rows include:
   - `id` as string
   - `line_count` equal to editor parsed non-empty line count
   - `slides` with valid `{ start_line, end_line }[]`
3. If mismatch persists, log and compare:
   - frontend `parseLyricLines(lyrics).length`
   - backend normalized `line_count`
   - original raw `community_templates.slides` payload for that CCLI.
