## Session: Grab Text + device upload + canvas eraser for announcement slides

### What we did
- **Grab Text (client-side OCR)**: Tesseract.js in the browser; "Grab Text" button on announcement slides (URL or device image) pre-fills Exact wording (title, subtitle, date, lines). Best for straight, Latin text. Research doc: `CANVA_GRAB_TEXT_RESEARCH.md`.
- **Device upload for announcement images**: Supabase Storage bucket `announcement-assets`; migration 014 (RLS policies). "Add files as slides" adds selected files as slides with `file` set; on "Add announcement to setlist" we upload files, get URLs, then save. Helper: `frontend/lib/utils/announcementUpload.ts`.
- **Canvas editor with frontend-only eraser**: react-konva modal — image + white brush strokes to cover text; "Save cleaned image" exports PNG, uploads, updates slide URL. No API (Fal/Replicate) for now; can add later.
- **Migration 014 fix**: PostgreSQL `CREATE POLICY` does not support `IF NOT EXISTS`. Changed to `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` + `CREATE POLICY` for idempotency. User ran migration successfully after fix.

### Files added/updated
- `frontend/lib/utils/grabTextOCR.ts` — Tesseract OCR, map lines to structuredText
- `frontend/lib/utils/announcementUpload.ts` — validate + upload to announcement-assets
- `frontend/components/events/AnnouncementCanvasEditor.tsx` — Konva Stage, image + eraser strokes, export PNG
- `frontend/components/events/SetlistLibrary.tsx` — Grab Text button, Clean image button, device "Add files as slides", upload on add to setlist, canvas editor modal (dynamic import)
- `supabase/migrations/014_announcement_storage.sql` — RLS for announcement-assets (drop + create policies)
- `CANVA_GRAB_TEXT_RESEARCH.md` — research on Canva Grab Text (confirmed vs inferred, pipeline, build-your-own guidance)

### Dependencies
- tesseract.js, react-konva@18, konva (frontend)

### Manual step
- Create bucket `announcement-assets` in Supabase Dashboard (Storage → New bucket, Public) if not exists.

### Commit
- `2196946` — feat: Grab Text + device upload + canvas eraser for announcement slides (committed and pushed)

### Wrap
- Updated MEMORY.md, PROJECT_PLAN.md, project-context.mdc, this daily log. Committed and pushed.

## Session: Event edit workspace + structured announcement text

### What we did
- **Event edit page – Spotify-style**: Left sidebar (EventFormCompact + Setlist / Content Library nav) + full-width main that switches views. New: `EventEditWorkspace`, `EventEditSidebar`, `EventFormCompact`, `SetlistView`. No more cramped two-column scroll frames.
- **View-switch animation**: Framer Motion (fade + slide 0.2s) when switching Setlist ↔ Content Library; `overflow-x-hidden` on main to avoid brief horizontal scrollbar.
- **Structured announcement text**: Optional `structuredText` (title, subtitle, date, lines) per slide. Editor has “Exact wording (recommended for names, dates)”. Backend sends `slideLines` when structuredText present; projector shows image-as-background + text overlay, or text-only. Backward compatible.

### Commits
- `2c38c60`, `ac5209c`, `b319b82`, `3692d84`, `cc62e39` (see MEMORY.md for messages).
