## Landing Page Gradient Restoration & Reference State Establishment

### Critical Event: Landing Page Protection Protocol Established

**This is the day we messed up our landing page and we don't do it again.**

### What Happened Today

#### 1. Multiple Landing Page Restorations ⚠️
- Started with wrong Spline (robot instead of mouse follow)
- Restored wrong gradient (radial orange instead of brown-to-blue fade)
- Multiple attempts to restore "yesterday's" state
- User had to guide us through exact restoration

#### 2. Final Restoration ✅
- **Gradient:** Restored brown-to-blue fade gradient
  - Extended brown/orange mix further down (to 30%)
  - Made bottom blue darker
  - Smooth transitions: `#1a0f0a 0%` → `#1a0f0a 30%` → `#0f0a1a 60%` → `#0a0f1a 80%` → `#000a1a 100%`
- **Spline:** Mouse follow effect (`kzdIEyudaZu1oiNQ`) - NOT robot
- **LyricsWall:** Restored to original (no orange effect overlay)

#### 3. Reference Document Created ✅
- Created `LANDING_PAGE_REFERENCE_FEB_2_2026.md`
- Documents exact configuration as definitive reference
- Includes "DO NOT CHANGE" warnings
- Provides restoration instructions

### Critical Rules Established

**Landing Page Protection Protocol:**
1. ❌ **NEVER** change landing page without asking user first
2. ❌ **NEVER** modify gradients, Spline, or backgrounds without approval
3. ✅ **ALWAYS** verify with user before committing landing page changes
4. ✅ **ALWAYS** reference the Feb 2, 2026 document when restoring

### Exact Configuration (Reference State)

**globals.css:**
```css
body {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #1a0f0a 0%, #1a0f0a 30%, #0f0a1a 60%, #0a0f1a 80%, #000a1a 100%);
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

**HeroSection.tsx:**
- Spline URL: `https://prod.spline.design/kzdIEyudaZu1oiNQ/scene.splinecode`
- Mouse follow effect (NOT robot)
- No 3D mockup in right column

**LyricWall.tsx:**
- No separate background
- Inherits body gradient
- No orange effect overlay

**page.tsx:**
- Simple `min-h-screen` class
- No gradient classes on main

### Visual Description

- **Top:** Brownish color (`#1a0f0a`) extends down to 30% of page
- **Middle:** Smooth transition from brown to dark blue
- **Bottom:** Darker blue (`#000a1a`) at the very bottom
- **Spline:** Mouse follow effect visible in hero section
- **Overall:** Beautiful fade from warm brown at top to cool dark blue at bottom

### Git Commits

- `00379cc` - Initial gradient restoration
- `[latest]` - Enhanced gradient with extended brown mix

### Lesson Learned

**Never modify the landing page without explicit user approval.** Always verify changes before committing. The landing page is a critical user-facing element and should remain stable unless the user explicitly requests changes.

### Documentation

- `LANDING_PAGE_REFERENCE_FEB_2_2026.md` - Permanent reference document
- Updated `MEMORY.md` with critical rules
- This daily memory file

**Status:** ✅ Reference state established and documented  
**Next Time:** If user asks to restore landing page, use Feb 2, 2026 reference state
