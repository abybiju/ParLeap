# Daily Memory - January 30, 2026

## Summary
Finished landing page work, fixed TypeScript errors, discussed Spline watermark removal options.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. TypeScript Fixes ✅
- Created `frontend/types/spline-viewer.d.ts` to declare custom web components
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to include types directory
- Fixed CI/CD type-check errors that were blocking the build pipeline
- Type-checking now passes locally

### 2. Tested Alternative Designs (Reverted)
- Tried black gradient instead of brown background
- Issue: Made robot's face too dark
- Solution: Reverted to current design (original gradient is optimal)
- Confirmed current pushed version is the best approach

### 3. Spline Watermark Research
- User asked about removing "Built with Spline" watermark
- **Finding**: Watermark is part of free tier licensing
- **Options explored**:
  1. Spline Pro ($12/month) - removes watermark
  2. Keep free tier - accept watermark (subtle, professional-looking)
  3. Migrate to Three.js - free alternative (requires coding, 2-4 days learning)
- **Recommendation**: Keep current setup (watermark is subtle and worth the ease of use)

### 4. Local Testing
- Dev server running successfully on port 3001
- Landing page looks good with Spline 3D background
- All visual elements working as expected

## Technical Notes
- Git commits are ready but push pending (network connectivity issue)
- Two commits waiting: landing page redesign + TypeScript fixes
- No code changes made today, only fixes and exploration

## Next Steps (When Time Permits)
- Push commits to GitHub when network is available
- Decide final stance on Spline watermark
- Continue with other feature development
- Consider Three.js migration if watermark removal becomes priority

## Key Decision
- Keeping Spline with free tier (accepts watermark)
- Alternative: Pay $12/month if watermark is objectionable for production
