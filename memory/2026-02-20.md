## Session: Landing/Footer/Pricing polish + Auth visual redesign

### What we shipped

**1. Landing footer replacement**
- Added new reusable hover primitives:
  - `frontend/components/ui/hover-footer.tsx`
- Added composed landing footer:
  - `frontend/components/layout/HoverFooter.tsx`
- Replaced footer usage on home page:
  - `frontend/app/page.tsx` now renders `HoverFooter`
- Iterated hover text + badge edge effect to match ParLeap style:
  - stronger text hover
  - animated orange edge-line loop around “AI Auto-Follow Ready”
  - tuned speed/glow after visual feedback

**2. Pricing animation refresh**
- Updated `frontend/components/landing/Pricing.tsx` with:
  - motion card staging
  - monthly/annual toggle
  - price transition animation
- Behavior refinement:
  - only **Worship Leader** changes on monthly/annual toggle
  - Starter (`$0`) and Multi-Campus (`Custom`) remain static

**3. Auth page redesign (login/signup only)**
- Added new auth visual shell:
  - `frontend/components/ui/sign-in-flow-1.tsx`
  - includes canvas reveal effect, shader matrix background, mini navbar, and frame component
- Updated:
  - `frontend/app/auth/login/page.tsx`
  - `frontend/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`
- Kept existing auth logic unchanged (Supabase sign-in/sign-up + validation + routing)
- Hid global header on redesigned routes:
  - `frontend/components/layout/ConditionalHeader.tsx` returns `null` for `/auth/login` and `/auth/signup`
- Added password visibility toggle (eye icon) while typing
- Added legal sentence with clickable links:
  - Product Terms
  - Policies
  - Privacy Notice
  - Cookie Notice

### Notes
- Local runtime issue reported from `@react-three/fiber` in user env; dependency versions were pinned in `frontend/package.json` for compatibility and user was instructed to reinstall locally.
- Type-check and lint pass in repo after changes.
