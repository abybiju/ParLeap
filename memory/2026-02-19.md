## Session: Railway backend build fix + docs/memory update

### What we did

**1. Railway backend build**
- Root cause: Nixpacks runs build in non-login shell → `tsc` not on PATH; `npx tsc` / `npx -p typescript tsc` used wrong package or separate TS without project node_modules → TS7016 (missing @types), TS7006 (implicit any). Also `node ../node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc` failed because TypeScript was only in devDependencies and Railway doesn’t install devDependencies.
- Fixes: (1) Build script uses `node ../node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc`. (2) typescript + @types/express, @types/cors, @types/string-similarity moved to dependencies. (3) backend/src/index.ts: all Express handlers typed with Request, Response, NextFunction.
- Result: Backend builds on Railway; local and CI pass.

**2. Documentation**
- RAILWAY_FIX.md: added section “Railway Backend Build Fix (February 19, 2026)” with problem, solution, result, and “don’t revert to” notes.
- MEMORY.md: new session entry for Feb 19 (Railway backend build fix, lesson, docs).
- .cursor/rules/project-context.mdc: added note under deployment/backend about TypeScript + @types in dependencies and build script.

**3. Memory**
- MEMORY.md updated with session summary and key lesson.
- memory/2026-02-19.md created (this file).
